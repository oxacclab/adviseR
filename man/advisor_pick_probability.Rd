advisor for given trust values. Assumes an adviseR::sigmoid picking behaviour
with slope 3 applied to weighted picked vs unpicked trusts.}

\item{trust_vector}{vector of subjective trust in advisors}

between trust difference and pick probability}
}

probability picked advisor is picked over unpicked advisor
}
