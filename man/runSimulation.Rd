\arguments{
\item{n}{list of numbers (participants and decisions) to simulate}

\item{conf}{whether or not agents use confidence to update trust}

\item{biasMean}{the mean for the agents' bias distribution (agents' biases
are drawn from normal distributions with mean +/- biasMean)}

\item{sensitivitySD}{standard deviation for distribution of agents'
sensitivity (mean is 1)}

\item{learningRate}{size of the trust update at each time step}

\item{randomSeed}{the random seed to start the simulation with}
