\arguments{
\item{n_agents}{number of nodes in the network}

\item{n_decisions}{number of decisions to simulate}

\item{conf}{whether or not agents use confidence to update trust}

\item{bias_mean}{the mean for the agents' bias distribution (agents' biases
are drawn from normal distributions with mean +/- biasMean)}

\item{bias_sd}{standard deviation for the bias distribution}

\item{sensitivity_sd}{standard deviation for distribution of agents'
sensitivity (mean is 1)}

\item{trust_volatility_mean}{the mean volatility of agents' trust}

\item{trust_volatility_sd}{standard deviation}

\item{bias_volatility_mean}{the mean volatility of agents' biases (move this
proportion towards the final decision value from current bias at each step)}

\item{bias_volatility_sd}{standard deviation}

\item{starting_graph}{single number, vector, or n_agents-by-n_agents matrix
of starting trust weights between agents. Coerced to numeric}

\item{randomSeed}{the random seed to start the simulation with}

\item{truth_fun}{function taking the simulation and decision number as
arguments and returning the true state of the world as a single number}

\item{weighted_sampling}{a non-zero/NA value means agents choose who to seek
advice from according to how likely they are to trust the advice. The
weights are multiplied by this value (so values > 1 make source selection
more pronounced than advice weighting, and values < 1 make source selection
less pronounced than advice weighting). Negative values will make agents
actively seek out those they do not trust for advice.}
