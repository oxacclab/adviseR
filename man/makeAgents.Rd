\arguments{
\item{n_agents}{number of agents to create}

\item{bias_mean}{the mean for the agents' bias distribution (agents' biases
are drawn from normal distributions with mean +/- biasMean)}

\item{bias_sd}{standard deviation for the bias distribution}

\item{sensitivity_sd}{standard deviation for distribution of agents'
sensitivity (mean is 1)}

\item{trust_volatility_mean}{the mean volatility of agents' trust}

\item{trust_volatility_sd}{standard deviation}

\item{bias_volatility_mean}{the mean volatility of agents' biases (move this
proportion towards the final decision value from current bias at each step)}

\item{bias_volatility_sd}{standard deviation}

\item{starting_graph}{single number, vector, or n_agents-by-n_agents matrix
of starting trust weights between agents. Coerced to numeric}

\description{
Agents are constructed with a bias on their binary decision (constant over
time) and a set of weights governing how seriously the advice of other agents
is taken (modified over time).
}
\details{
the \code{agents} tibble is an n_agents*n_decisions by 12 table with
\itemize{
\item{"id"}{The agent's identifier}
\item{"decision"}{The decision number}
\item{"sensitivity"}{The agent's ability to do the task}
\item{"trust_volatility"}{How quickly the agent's trust updates}
\item{"bias_volatility"}{How quickly the agent's bias updates}
\item{"bias"}{The agent's (initial) bias}
\item{"truth"}{The true state of the world (same for a given decision for all agents)}
\item{"initial"}{The agent's initial estimate of the truth}
\item{"advisor"}{ID of the agent whose advice is received}
\item{"weight"}{The weight assigned to the advice by the agent}
\item{"final"}{The final decision of the agent}
}
}
