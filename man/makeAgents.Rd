\arguments{

\item{n_decisions}{number of decisions}

\item{biasMean}{the mean for the agents' bias distribution (agents' biases
are drawn from normal distributions with mean +/- biasMean)}

\item{biasSD}{standard deviation for the bias distribution}

\item{sensitivitySD}{standard deviation for distribution of agents'
sensitivity (mean is 1)}
