#' Agents are constructed with a bias on their binary decision (constant over
#' time) and a set of weights governing how seriously the advice of other agents
#' is taken (modified over time).
#' @param n_agents number of agents to create
#' @param n_decisions number of decisions
#' @param bias_mean the mean for the agents' bias distribution (agents' biases
#'   are drawn from normal distributions with mean +/- biasMean). Translated via
#'   sigmoid function to between 0 and 1, and represents the prior probability
#'   that the answer is 1.
#' @param bias_sd standard deviation for the bias distribution
#' @param sensitivity_sd standard deviation for distribution of agents'
#'   sensitivity (mean is 1)
#' @param trust_volatility_mean the mean volatility of agents' trust
#' @param trust_volatility_sd standard deviation
#' @param bias_volatility_mean the mean volatility of agents' biases (move this
#'   proportion towards the final decision value from current bias at each step)
#' @param bias_volatility_sd standard deviation
#' @param confidence_slope_mean the mean of the distribution from which agents
#'   take their slopes for the sigmoid function mapping continuous evidence to
#'   a probability of a categorical decision.
#' @param confidence_slope_sd standard deviation
#' @param weighted_sampling_mean a non-zero value means agents choose who to
#'   seek advice from according to how likely they are to trust the advice. The
#'   weights are raised to the power of this value (so values > 1 make source
#'   selection more pronounced than advice weighting, and values < 1 make source
#'   selection less pronounced than advice weighting). Negative values will make
#'   agents actively seek out those they do not trust for advice.
#' @param weighted_sampling_sd standard deviation
#' @param starting_graph single number, vector, or n_agents-by-n_agents matrix
#'   of starting trust weights between agents. Coerced to numeric. Can also be
#'   a function taking the first generation of the agents tbl as an input and
#'   returning an n-by-n matrix of trust values between 0 and 1, where n is the
#'   number of agents, 0 represents completely untrustworthy, .5 random, and 1
#'   completely trustworthy.

#'  \item{"trust_volatility"}{How quickly the agent's trust updates}
#'  \item{"bias_volatility"}{How quickly the agent's bias updates}
#'  \item{"weighted_sampling"}{How heavily trust governs advice sampling behaviour}
#'  \item{"bias"}{The agent's (initial) bias}
#'  \item{"truth"}{The true state of the world (same for a given decision for all agents)}
#'  \item{"initial"}{The agent's initial estimate of the truth}
