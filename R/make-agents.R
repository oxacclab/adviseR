#' Agents are constructed with a bias on their binary decision (constant over
#' time) and a set of weights governing how seriously the advice of other agents
#' is taken (modified over time).
#' @param n_agents number of agents to create
#' @param n_decisions number of decisions
#' @param bias_mean the mean for the agents' bias distribution (agents' biases
#'   are drawn from normal distributions with mean +/- biasMean)
#' @param bias_sd standard deviation for the bias distribution
#' @param sensitivity_sd standard deviation for distribution of agents'
#'   sensitivity (mean is 1)
#' @param trust_volatility_mean the mean volatility of agents' trust
#' @param trust_volatility_sd standard deviation
#' @param bias_volatility_mean the mean volatility of agents' biases
#' @param bias_volatility_sd standard deviation
