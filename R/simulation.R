#' Run the simulation
#' @param n_agents number of nodes in the network
#' @param n_decisions number of decisions to simulate
#' @param decision_flags numeric vector recycled to \code{length(n_decisions)}
#'   containing boolean flags for which components of the simulation to run at
#'   each decision point.
#'   This vector can be used to e.g. run several decisions without updating
#'   biases before allowing biases to update on the resulting trust network.
#'   Flag values are 1 = trust update; 2 = bias update. Defaults to all.
#' @param bias_mean the mean for the agents' bias distribution (agents' biases
#'   are drawn from normal distributions with mean +/- biasMean). Capped to
#'   between 0 and 1, and represents the prior probability that the answer is 1.
#' @param bias_sd standard deviation for the bias distribution
#' @param sensitivity_mean mean for agents' sensitivity
#' @param sensitivity_sd standard deviation for distribution of agents'
#'   sensitivity (mean is 1)
#' @param trust_volatility_mean the mean volatility of agents' trust
#' @param trust_volatility_sd standard deviation
#' @param bias_volatility_mean the mean volatility of agents' biases (move this
#'   proportion towards the final decision value from current bias at each step)
#' @param bias_volatility_sd standard deviation
#' @param confidence_slope_mean the mean of the distribution from which agents
#'   take their slopes for the sigmoid function mapping continuous evidence to
#'   a probability of a categorical decision. \code{\link{abs}} is used to
#'   avoid negative slopes.
#' @param confidence_slope_sd standard deviation
#' @param weighted_sampling_mean a non-zero value means agents choose who to
#'   seek advice from according to how likely they are to trust the advice. The
#'   weights are raised to the power of this value (so values > 1 make source
#'   selection more pronounced than advice weighting, and values < 1 make source
#'   selection less pronounced than advice weighting). Negative values will make
#'   agents actively seek out those they do not trust for advice.
#' @param weighted_sampling_sd standard deviation
#' @param bias_update_slope value used (for all agents) as the slope of the bias
#'   update function
#' @param starting_graph single number, vector, or n_agents-by-n_agents matrix
#'   of starting trust weights between agents. Coerced to numeric. Can also be
#'   a function taking the first generation of the agents tbl as an input and
#'   returning an n-by-n matrix of trust values between 0 and 1, where n is the
#'   number of agents, 0 represents completely untrustworthy, .5 random, and 1
#'   completely trustworthy.
#' @param random_seed the random seed to start the simulation with. If set, this
#'   is used to generate the random seeds for agent construction and simulation
#'   (unless those seeds are explicitly specified). This means output is
#'   reproducible even if only this seed is set.
#' @param .random_seed_agents random seed for agent construction
#' @param .random_seed_simulation random seed for simulation
#' @param truth_fun function taking the simulation and decision number as
#'   arguments and returning the true state of the world as a single number
#' @param truth_sd standard deviation of the truth function that the agents use
#'   to calculate the probability of values given their biases.
#' @param confidence_weighted whether agents use their own confidence in initial
#'   decisions to weigh their updating of trust in other agents. If F, agents
#'   simply examine whether other agents agree (although this produces a cliff
#'   whereby slight agreement and slight disagreement produce results as
#'   different as extreme agreement and extreme disagreement).
#' @param model if present as a data frame output similar to that produced by
#'   \code{\link{makeAgents}}, this model is used instead of being generated
#'   automatically. If this is specified, the other model parameters giving
#'   means and SDs for agent properties are for reference only, and the
#'   properties which describe the model (e.g. n_agents) should match the
#'   values extracted from this data frame.
